# Random Password Generator

## DESCRIPTION
With prewritten HTML and CSS, I created a random password generator using JavaScript. This allows for the user to select a password with a length between 8-128 characters. The user also gets to select the type of characters they would like to use, with the options of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters.
<br/>
<br/>
As an individual who has many profiles that require secure, strong passwords, I wanted to build an app that took the stress out of having to think of passwords on my own. This way I don't have to rely on the same password for every account I have. 
<br/>
<br/>
While building this app, I learned a lot about looping through arrays. This also taught me about user activity with prompts.
